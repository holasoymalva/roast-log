# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Console.roast is a Node.js library that enhances the classic console.log experience by adding humorous comments and reactions. The library intercepts console.log calls and adds witty, sarcastic, or encouraging remarks in English, making debugging and development more entertaining. The library integrates with Anthropic's API to generate dynamic, context-aware humorous responses based on what's being logged.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace my standard console.log with a more entertaining version, so that my debugging sessions become more enjoyable and less monotonous.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports console.roast THEN the system SHALL override the default console.log behavior
2. WHEN console.log is called THEN the system SHALL display the original message along with a humorous comment
3. WHEN the library is imported THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing console.log usage
4. WHEN console.log is called with multiple arguments THEN the system SHALL handle all arguments correctly while adding humor

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the humorous comments to be varied and contextually relevant, so that the experience doesn't become repetitive or annoying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console.log is called repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide different humorous responses each time
2. WHEN the logged content contains specific patterns (errors, numbers, objects, etc.) THEN the system SHALL generate contextually appropriate humor
3. WHEN the Anthropic API is available THEN the system SHALL use it to generate dynamic responses
4. WHEN the Anthropic API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to a predefined set of humorous comments
5. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL ensure comments are in English and appropriate for professional environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the humor level and frequency, so that I can customize the experience to my preferences and work environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the library THEN the system SHALL accept configuration options for humor intensity
2. WHEN configured with different humor levels THEN the system SHALL adjust the tone from mild to sarcastic
3. WHEN configured with frequency settings THEN the system SHALL allow controlling how often humorous comments appear
4. WHEN configured to disable humor THEN the system SHALL revert to standard console.log behavior
5. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to integrate seamlessly with Anthropic's API, so that I can get AI-generated humorous responses that are more creative and varied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is configured with an Anthropic API key THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with the API
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits gracefully
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to local humorous comments without breaking the logging
4. WHEN sending data to the API THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information from logs
5. WHEN receiving API responses THEN the system SHALL validate and format the humorous content appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to have minimal performance impact, so that it doesn't slow down my application during development or debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console.log is called THEN the system SHALL add minimal latency to the logging operation
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid repeated requests for similar content
3. WHEN the system is under heavy logging load THEN it SHALL implement throttling to prevent API abuse
4. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL maintain a small memory footprint
5. WHEN the library is disabled THEN the system SHALL have zero performance impact

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy installation and setup, so that I can start using the humorous logging immediately without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing via npm THEN the system SHALL install all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN importing the library THEN the system SHALL work with a single require/import statement
3. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the system SHALL provide proper type definitions
4. WHEN no API key is provided THEN the system SHALL work with built-in humor without requiring external services
5. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples and configuration options
